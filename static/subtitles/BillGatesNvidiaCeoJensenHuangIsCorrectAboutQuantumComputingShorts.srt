Jensen's correct, it could take longer.

This is both in terms of how you build a quantum computer

00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,099
and what software you write that can solve problems

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,900
that other computer couldn't write,

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,800
there's some hard work to be done.
