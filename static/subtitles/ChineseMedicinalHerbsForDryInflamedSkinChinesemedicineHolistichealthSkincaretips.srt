00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
To help treat the root cause of my inflamed dry skin, I went to pick up these

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,599
chains but it still herbs to help with anti-inflammation and hydrating my body.

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,439
So we have lotus seeds and red juice which are great for calming inflammation, then I got

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:14,560
some more special ketonic ingredients that are also anti-inflammatory, but much more powerful,

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,699
like ginseng, shuhu, and koresubs.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,059
You can make these in a tea but I prefer their taste in a soup.
